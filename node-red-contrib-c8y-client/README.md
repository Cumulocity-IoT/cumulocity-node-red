# Cumulocity nodes for Node-RED

This package provides a few nodes which are using the microservice credentials to connect to Cumulocity.
There are multiple nodes to subscribe for realtime updates of the different Cumulocity APIs and a single node to execute requests to some endpoint of the tenant.
